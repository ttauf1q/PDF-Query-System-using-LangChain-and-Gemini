# PDF Query System using LangChain and Gemini

This project leverages LangChain and Google's Gemini model to build an intelligent PDF query system. It enables users to extract and interact with information from PDF documents using natural language queries. By integrating LangChainâ€™s document loaders, text splitting, and retrieval capabilities with Gemini's advanced language understanding, the system efficiently processes and responds to user queries.
